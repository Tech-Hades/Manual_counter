# Manual Counter using Arduino UNO
Manual counter using Arduino UNO. The code and the circuit diagram are included in the repository!  
<br>
The coding is done using Arduino IDE platform and the compiled hex file is uploaded to the Arduino board in Proteus 8 software.  
<br>
Each time the push button is pressed, Arduino gets the input from it, increases the counting number value and displays it in the 7 segment display. It counts from 0-9, and repeats the cycle with a delay.
